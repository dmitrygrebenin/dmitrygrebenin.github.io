            The app follows the standards of WCAG up to at least level A with most level AA and some level AAA requirements
            met. The navigation is always in the bottom of the display as mobile users tend to use their phones with one
            hand and reaching the top part of the display is difficult (especially with the advent of tall diplay aspect
            ratios) (Fei, 2013). The company's brand color is used as an accent in some sections (the membership table
            and artist biography background, and the library). The app is responsive and supports most smartphone,
            tablet and desktop displays. The images have been scaled down appropriately to reduce network usage.<br><br>
